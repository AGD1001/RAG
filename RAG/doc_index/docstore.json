So the Fox, who had consented to act as judge, marked the distance \nand started the runners off.  \n \nThe Hare was soon far out of sight, and to make the Tortoise fe el very deeply how ridiculous \nit was for him to try a race with a Hare, he lay down beside the course to take a nap until the \nTortoise should catch up.  \n \n \nThe Tortoise meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily, and, after a time, passed the place \nwhere the H are was sleeping.
